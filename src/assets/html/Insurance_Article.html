                    <p align="justify">The life cycle of any insurance policy always begins with marketing.  This refers to the company making available the knowledge of the insurance  products it has to offer to the prospective clients. This is done through many  channels, such as Television and Internet ads, Worksite marketing, Direct  marketing and Broking. It is only through aggressive marketing that an  insurance company can ensure a successful sale of its products. </p>
                      <p align="justify">After marketing comes the role of the client who wants the insurance.  Typically, when a client decides that he needs an insurance policy, he  approaches either an Agent or a Broker for financial advice on what type of  policy is best suited to his demands. This scenario is now changing with Insurance  companies actively and directly targeting their prospective clients directly  and thus, creating business where business might not have been possible.</p>
                      <p align="justify">Once a client decides what type of insurance policy he wants to opt  for, he is required to fill up an application form, which is the main source of  information for the company about the client. Various regulations are in place  in all countries to standardize the format of the application form. Prior  approval needs be taken from the government before introducing a new  application into the market. The information gathered in the application form  includes various details such as the name, sex, DOB, smoking habits of the  Proposed Insured and the Policy Owner, if other than the Insured and also the  details of the Beneficiary. The client also has the option of making an advance  payment towards the premium amount, but this is not mandatory. Once he/she  fills up the application form, the data is entered into the Insurance company&rsquo;s  &lsquo;New Business System&rsquo;, which validates the data as it is entered. Once all the  data is entered and validated, a system generated unique Policy Number is  allocated to the policy. From here on, the policy is accessed using this unique  reference number along with some other detail of the client, typically their  surname. The company may then request for various medical tests and  inspections, driving history and other report depending on the risk associated  with the policy. </p>
                      <p align="justify">At this point, the most important process of a Life Insurance policy  takes place, which is the Underwriting. Underwriting refers to the process of  evaluation of the risk on the policy. This is done by qualified underwriters of  the Insurance Company. The underwriter looks at various details of the Insured,  such as age, health and lifestyle habits, medical and driving history, all of  which is collected beforehand. Based on this information, the underwriter  places the insured into a predefined Mortality block. The mortality block then  defines the premium rates that would be applicable to the insured. This is all  translated to a rating and assigned to the policy. The Underwriter may also  arrive at the conclusion that the risk of insuring the Proposed Insured is too  high. He then has the option of declining the policy or opting for a  reinsurance, which refers to passing on a portion of the risk to a third party  Insurance vendor. If the policy is declined, the life cycle of the policy ends  here. The client is informed that the risk is too high and the Proposed Insured  cannot be insured by the company. If reinsurance is opted for, the company then  negotiates with the third party vendor on the premiums it has to pay to the  vendor for the risk accepted by them. </p>
                      <p align="justify">After the rating is assigned to the policy, the policy information is  passed on to downstream systems which calculate the actual premiums that are to  be paid based on the payment modes preferred by the client and selected in the  application form. The policy is then said to be produced, provided the policy  does not encounter any other problems in processing. Once the policy is  produced and the hard copy policy is printed, the &lsquo;Free-look&rsquo; period begins.  This period refers to the time during which the Policy Owner has the provision  of going through the entire printed policy, understand all the terms and  conditions and clear out any irregularities in it. If he/she decides that the  terms are not as per their expectation, due to any unspecified reason, he/she  can request to have the policy wordings changed. If the client is still dissatisfied  with the policy, he/she can refuse the policy without any obligations to the  company. Any payments made up to this point are returned to the client without  any questions asked. Typically, this free-look period ranges from 10-15 days  and is a mandatory requirement for all Life Insurance policies. </p>
                      <p align="justify">At the end of free-look period, the client is required to sign the  printed policy. Once the client accepts the terms under the printed policy and  signs on the dotted line, the policy is said to be &lsquo;In-force&rsquo;. This is the  point of no return. During the time when the policy is in-force, regular  premiums are collected as per the payment schedule opted by the client. While  the policy is in-force, the Policy Owner can avail of various benefits detailed  in the policy terms. These include the possibility of availing a loan on the  policy, periodic dividends and Waiver of Premiums. All these benefits are  dependant on the type of policy opted by the Policy Owner.</p>
                      <p align="justify">The policy can now be terminated in more than one way. One is the  obvious reason being the expiry of the Insured. The policy owner also has the  option of surrendering the policy to the company while the policy is in-force  and the company completes the payment of amount payable to the Policy Owner, if  any and terminates the contract. Another way is the completion of the term of  the policy, in case of a Term policy. Of course, in case of a Whole Life  insurance, which covers the Insured throughout his/her life, the policy cannot  be terminated in this way. In addition, a Term policy can also be converted to  a Whole Life policy.</p>
                      <p align="justify">Once the Insured expires, it is the responsibility of the Beneficiary  named in the policy to inform the Insurance Company of the event, following  which the company conducts various verification procedures. Once all the  verification procedures are complete and the event of death is confirmed, the  &lsquo;Claims&rsquo; process begins.&nbsp; In this  process, the company begins the disbursal of funds, including the Death Benefit  and any additional rider benefits plus the Cash Value, to the beneficiary based  on the options selected by the Policy Owner at the time of the policy issuance.  This can be any among a one time lump-sum payment, a repetitive payment for a  fixed period of time or a repetitive payment for the entire lifetime of the  beneficiary. In the last option, the policy is terminated only at the demise of  the beneficiary. In all other modes, the policy is terminated when the last  payment is made to the beneficiary.</p>
                      <p align="justify">Thus ends the life cycle of a Life Insurance policy.</p>

The coverage is purchased by property owners to cover their potential  losses and liabilities that might occur due to terrorist activities</p>
                    <p align="justify">Prior to  9/11 attack, standard commercial insurance policies included terrorism coverage  as part of the package, effectively free of charge, many  insurers considered the risk posed by terrorism to be negligible, so its cover was  implicitly included into their general property and casualty policies. There were  no additional riders to obtain terrorism insurance, like many homeowners have  for their jewelry or other valuables. The market for this coverage could be  generally described as liquid and readily available at highly competitive  premiums. These acts were viewed as isolated attacks of fringe organizations,  and unlikely to cause the type of damage that could undermine the stability of  the insurance industry. </p>
                    <p align="justify">The coordinated attacks of the World Trade Centers and  Pentagon by a group of international terrorists forever changed this view. The  &lsquo;tide went out&rsquo; on the terrorism insurance market.</p>
                    <p align="justify">The unforgettable day of September 11, 2001 infamously known as 9/11 changed the way the world of insurers, looked at  terrorism risk. Insurers and reinsurers sustained unimaginable losses. Insurers  realized that their coverage of landmark building included terrorism insurance  virtually free of cost. The attack resulted in an estimated $50  billion in insured losses. The losses occurred across many types of coverage,  including commercial property, business interruption, workers compensation,  aviation, life and disability insurance.</p>
                    <p align="justify"><strong>United    States</strong><strong> </strong><br />
The post September 11 terrorist acts that hit the US - the  most costly disaster ever for the insurance industry - conditions on terrorism  insurance markets have improved.<br />
Pursuant to the Terrorism Risk and Insurance Act  (TRIA) in 2002, Insurance losses attributable to terrorist acts under these  commercial policies are insured by private insurers and reinsured or  &ldquo;backstopped&rdquo; by the federal government. <br />
</p>
                    <p align="justify"><strong>TRIA (2002) - </strong><strong>Terrorism Risk Insurance Act</strong><br />
                      TRIA is a public/private risk-sharing partnership between  the federal government and the insurance industry. The program is designed to  ensure that adequate resources are available for businesses to recover and  rebuild if they become the victims of a terrorist attack.<br />
                      TRIA was first enacted in November 26, 2002 when  there was a severe market shortage for terrorism coverage after the 9/11  terrorist attack in US.&nbsp; TRIA defined  terrorism coverage limited to violent acts certified by Treasury Secretary, in  concurrence with Secretary of State and Attorney General, to have been  committed by or on behalf of a foreign person or interest to coerce or  influence US policy.<br />
                      Most commercial property and casual lines including  workers comp and surety but excluded crop, private mortgage, medical  malpractice, financial guarantee, reinsurance and flood provided under NFIP. No  health or group life insurance had this coverage. The act expired on December  2005.<br />
                      Specific provisions of the legislation are:</p>
                    
                    
                        <div align="justify">
                              <ul type="square">
                                <li>An       event must cause at least $5 million in aggregate property and casualty       insurance losses to be certified by the Secretary of the Treasury as an       act of terrorism.</li>
                                <li>The       bill is limited to international terrorism committed on behalf of any       foreign person or foreign interest on U.S.       soil. (Damage to an air carrier or vessel outside the U.S., or       to a the premises of a U.S.       mission is covered by TRIA, however)</li>
                                <li>Each       participating insurer is responsible for paying out a certain amount in       claims &ndash; a deductible -- before Federal assistance becomes available.</li>
                                <li>For       losses above a company&rsquo;s deductible, the federal government will cover 90       percent, while the insurer contributes 10 percent.</li>
                                <li>The       aggregate insurance industry retention in 2004 is $12.5 billion in 2004       and $15 billion in 2005.</li>
                                <li>Losses       covered by the program are capped at $100 billion.</li>
                                <li>Lines       excluded from the program are: personal lines (auto and home), assumed       reinsurance, federal crop, mortgage guaranty, financial guaranty, medical       malpractice, flood insurance and life &amp; health.</li>
                                <li>The       Act sunsets after three years on December 31, 2005.</li>
                              </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p align="justify">TRIA was  passed in 2002 to create a three-year federal program that backs up insurance  companies and guarantees that certain terrorist-related claims will be paid.  The program was recently extended by two years as Congress decides whether it  should be renewed and, if so, how much money will be available for claims.<br />
                        <br />
                      Congress had planned TRIA to be a temporary solution while insurance companies  had time to develop appropriate coverage in the post-9/11 world. But insurance  companies have argued that they will still need government backup to provide  meaningful coverage.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
                      While it is true that a few insurers are offering limited,  restrictive and expensive coverage for terrorism, the <strong>insurance</strong> <strong>industry</strong> cannot underwrite the level of coverage the country wants and needs.<br />
  </p>
                    <p align="justify"><strong>Terrorism  Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2005 (TRIREA)</strong><br />
                      TRIA act was extended up to December 31, 2007 called  Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2005 (TRIREA). <br />
                    </p>
                    <p align="justify">Almost all programs remain the same as TRIA certain  provisions have changed including the threshold for activation of coverage and  insurer deductibles. The act deleted terrorism cover from commercial lines such  as commercial auto, professional liability(other than D&amp;O), surety, burglary  &amp; theft and farm owners multiple peril insurance.<br />
                      There was a significant improvement to the bill  including a mandatory offering for nuclear, biological, chemical and  radiological (NBCR) coverage, addition of group life, a15 year-term, a reset  mechanism to reduce insurer industry retentions for sites already victimized by  terrorism, and elimination of the distinction between acts of foreign and  domestic terrorism.<br />
                    </p>
                    <p align="justify"><strong>Terrorism  Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (TRIPRA)</strong><br />
                      On Dec 18,   2007, Congress approved the extension of TRIA and on December 26, 2007 the Act  was signed and enacted by US President Bush. The new act extends till December 31, 2014 <br />
                      The most significant change in this act is that the  definition of &ldquo;act of terrorism&rdquo; has been revised. The requirement that the act  be committed by an individual acting on behalf of any foreign person or foreign  interest in order for the act to be certified as an &ldquo;act of terrorism&rdquo; for  purposes of reimbursement has been removed. In other words, the Reauthorization  Act covers domestic terrorism, which was excluded by previous version of  TRIA.&nbsp; The insurers will comply with this  new definition of TRIA.<br />
                      As per this revised act, insurers may charge  additional premium to cover what was previously understood as &ldquo;non certified&rsquo;  acts if they were not previous provided in this coverage. The distinction  remains with acts that are certified and non-certified, however the distinction  mainly based on the location. <br />
                      The act requires insurers to provide clear and  conspicuous disclosure of requirements of certain sections of TRIA which sates:</p>

                                <li>No insurer that has met its deductible should be liable for       the payment of any portion of that amount that exceeds 100       million.</li>
                              </ul>

This amount rises from $15       billion in 2005 to $25 billion in 2006 and rises again in 2007 to $27.5       billion. The difference between this amount and the aggregate amount that       insurers must pay (deductibles and co-payments) can be recouped from       commercial policyholders through a surcharge not to exceed 3 percent of       premium for insurance coverages that fall under the TRIEA program. This       reinsurance takes the form of a 90 percent quota share in excess of       variable deductibles based upon a percentage of earned premium income. </li>

                      Post 9/11 attacks, all insurers have introduced new war  and terrorism exclusions to their policy wordings for new and existing  policies. Previously the Government backed terrorism facility provided  terrorism cover for individual policyholders over and above the heads of cover  provided by the underlying commercial property covers up to the total sum  insured or limit of liability.<br />
  <br />
                      The withdrawal of terrorism coverage led to an immediate  and spectacular demand for terrorism coverage, making London, with its  existing product knowledge, AIG and Bermuda  the largest markets. <br />
                      In the ninth months after the 9/11 attack, market grew  substantially with several new entrants. The largest was Axis Specialty in Bermuda, which provided  new capacity of up to $100 million for each risk. Capacity for stand-alone  terrorism also increased with Lloyds. Berkshire Hathaway attracted by the high  rates and strong demand, also entered the fray and was able to offer US $500  million of capacity per risk. </p>
                    <p align="justify">Few territories operate their own terrorism insurance schemes.  Those that do each operate under different rules, with differing definitions of  a terrorist act. Terrorism may still be available in some territories that do  not operate separate terrorism insurance schemes although it is often subject  to inner or &lsquo;per incident limits&rsquo;. Terrorism insurance may not be available  locally for many territories. Some territories operate terrorist insurance  schemes only for government buildings or projects. </p>
                    <div align="justify"><strong>Europe </strong><br />
                    Several European countries have schemes covering terrorism  events. As with other territories offering State-backed terrorism cover, there  is no common approach regarding the terrorism definition and the provided  coverage. European States offering terrorism coverage at this time are:                    </div>
                    <p align="justify"><strong>Austria</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                      The Austrian terrorism cover (&lsquo;Terror pool Austria&rsquo;,  developed by the Austrian Insurance Association) is a reinsurance of property  damage and business interruption with the reinsured perils limited to fire,  explosion, malicious damage, civil commotion and impact. This reinsurance  applies only to risks located within Austria  and is not compulsory. Whilst this is reinsurance, the direct writing insurer  will issue a separate terrorism policy. <br />
                      Utilizing a mixture of capacity from local insurance  companies, international reinsurers and government <br />
                      Guarantees, a total capacity of .800m is available  although the limit per policy is .20m. </p>
                    <p align="justify"><strong>France</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                      Terrorism exclusions applying to assets in France  are not allowed under French law. The GAREAT reinsurance pool (Gestion de  l&rsquo;Assurances et de la Reassurance des Risques attentats et actes de terrorisme)  provides reinsurance for member direct writing insurers and both membership and <br />
                      reinsurance is compulsory for local insurers.  Overseas-based insurers can become members of GAREAT. Reinsurance applies only  to risks located in France. <br />
                      With a mixture of conventional reinsurance and State  cover, there is no upper limit on sums insured. Reinsurance applies only on  values above .6m. </p>
                    <p align="justify"><strong>Germany</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                      In Germany,  no terrorism exclusion is valid in respect of commercial property/business  interruption policies up to total sum insured of .25m. For risks exceeding .25m  total sum insured, terrorism will be excluded by local policies. </p>
                    <p align="justify">For these larger risks, terrorism insurance is available  via Extremus Versicherungs AG. With capacity from local direct and reinsurance  companies, the international reinsurance market and the German government, the  total available limit is .13bn in the annual aggregate. <br />
                      Participation is optional and applies only to risks within  Germany. </p>
                    <p align="justify"><strong>The </strong><strong>Netherlands</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                      Terrorism risks in Holland will usually  be reinsured with the Nederlandse Herverzekeringsmaatschappij voor  Terrorismeschaden N.V. (Dutch Terrorism Risk Reinsurance Company &ndash; NHT). This  reinsurance will usually apply to member insurers for all policies for risks in  Holland  other than where the terms cannot be altered and terrorism cannot be excluded  e.g. long-term policies such as life assurance. If the Insured elects to insure  terrorism, the insurer must reinsure with NHT. </p>
                    <p align="justify">The maximum sum payable during any one year is .1bn across  all reinsured losses. If losses exceed this amount, claim payments will be  proportionately reduced. This limit is funded by a combination of direct and  reinsurance market participation and the Dutch government. <br />
                      In respect of property and business interruption exposures  there is a maximum limit of .75m per insured location per year. </p>
                    <p align="justify"><strong>Spain</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                      There is obligatory State cover for properties located in Spain  where property insurance is arranged. Cover is provided by the State owned  Consorcio de Compensaci&oacute;n de Seguros. Limited to properties located in Spain  or terrorist acts committed on Spanish Territory,  cover is available for private <br />
                      Properties, commercial and industrial properties, business  interruption, theft, plate glass, machinery breakdown, electrical equipment,  civil works, motor vehicles, rail track vehicles and personal accident risks.  Limits will be the same as the main policy limits.</p>
                    <p align="justify"><strong>Australia</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                      Terrorism insurance for property damage is compulsory but  optional for business interruption. Other overseas territories Other  territories offering State-backed terrorism insurance are Australia,  Israel,  Namibia,  South Africa  and Sri Lanka.  Within Sri Lanka,  most local insurers place terrorism with a government fund. Available capacity  is RS25m maximum limit. Funded by a property tax, the Israeli government will <br />
                    pay for direct property losses on a market value basis  with consequential losses indemnified only where the property is situated near  border areas. The Israeli fund will also provide compensation following bodily  injury to individuals. Details of the other territories offering terrorism  insurance are: </p>
                    <p align="justify">Australian legislation &ndash; the Terrorism Insurance Act 2003  (&lsquo;TIA&rsquo;) &ndash; came into effect 1 July 2003. </p>
                    <p align="justify">The TIA states that in the event of the Australian  Government declaring that a &lsquo;terrorist incident&rsquo; has occurred, any terrorism  exclusion clause in an eligible policy becomes inoperative and cover is  provided for terrorism losses in accordance with the other terms and conditions  of the policy. The legislation applies to all insurers including captives  regardless of domicile. </p>
                    <p align="justify">The Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation (ARPC) is set  up to provide reinsurance in conjunction with IA but it is not compulsory  reinsurance and is not available to Insurers that do not specifically exclude  the defined terrorism acts under the original policy. If there is exclusion and  a terrorist act is declared, the exclusion is voided and indemnity from ARPC  applies up to the general limits/sub-limits under individual policies. </p>
                    <p align="justify">There is a compulsory retention imposed upon Insurers  dependant upon the level of fire premiums underwritten and reported to  Australian regulators but the retention will not exceed A$1m in any one year  for each insurer. There is effectively a cap of A$10bn per incident which is  brought into effect by virtue of the Minister having the power to declare a  &lsquo;reduction percentage&rsquo; if the Minister had reason to believe that the total  cost would otherwise exceed this limit. Such reduction would be borne by the Insured&rsquo;s  (not Insurers). </p>
                    <p align="justify">It is expected that most global Insurers with subsidiaries  domiciled in Australia  will insist on issuing local policies to access their reinsurance arrangements  with the ARPC. However, foreign insurers (including Captives) can access the  ARPC directly. </p>
                    <p align="justify">The TIA only applies to acts happening in Australia  for damage otherwise insured in the commercial property in Australia.  Cover also applies to Public Liability policies but only to the extent of  liability as a property owner or occupier. </p>
                    <p align="justify"><strong>Namibia</strong><strong> </strong></p>
                    <p align="justify">The National Special Risks Insurance Association (NASRIA)  was set up by the Namibian government in 1987 to mirror the specialist covers  offered by the South African Special Risks Insurance Association to insure  risks of riots, strikes and civil commotion. This cover was more recently  extended to include terrorism risks. Cover is available for property and  business interruption as well as crime and motor risks. The <br />
                      available property limit is N$100m. </p>
                    <p align="justify"><strong>South Africa</strong> </p>
                    <p align="justify">The South African Special Risks Insurance Association  (SASRIA) is a government-owned insurer formed in 1979 to cover political  unrest/riot exposures with the cover now extended to include terrorism risks  (as defined) within South Africa.  Insured have an automatic right to the cover, with the insurer, acting as an  agent of SASRIA, issuing an appropriate coupon to provide the insurance. </p>
                    <p align="justify">Cover can be provided for property damage (fire/all  risks), computers, money, transit, mining, construction and plant, and motor  risks. Business interruption is provided only for standing charges and working  expenses but with the terms and limits otherwise following the main policy.  However, limits are on a full value at risk basis even if the main policy is  limited to a first loss basis but subject to a maximum limit of R300m any one insured.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Separate and stand alone terrorism insurance remains a  valuable option for those Insured requiring standardized global property damage  terrorism cover. Also, bespoke cover can be negotiated, including Difference in  Conditions/ Difference in Limits or excluded cover for those territories that  operate their own separate terrorism insurance, as well as full cover for those  territories where terrorism insurance is <br />
                      not otherwise available. Capacity in the global markets  for terrorism property and business interruption insurance remains significant  at circa 1bn.</p>
                    <p align="justify"><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
                      It is too early in the life-cycle most terrorism schemes  in countries to make firm assessments regarding successful good practice in  their establishment and operation. Equally the outlook for future terrorism  acts and events remains uncertain, as does the potential response of insurance  markets to them. In addition, <br />
                    It is hard to rank terrorism&rsquo;s future position among other  priorities (like environmental risks). Finally it remains unclear how far  terrorism risks are met by the insurance companies.</p>
