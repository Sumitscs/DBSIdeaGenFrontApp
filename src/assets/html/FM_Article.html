                      Global stock exchange industry of late is going through rough weather  after the emergence of faster Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTF). It is  interesting to see that multilateral trading facility Chi-X has recently  announced good profits and this makes one think about how they will fare in the  next year, as all the other new MTFs come in. So far Chi-X has been successful  but surely times will become tougher with greater competition.</p>
                      <p align="justify" class="Content">All MTFs broadly offer similar services and currently USP of all of them  is speed and low cost of their trading engines. Assuming that speed is the  single most benchmark that all the MTFs are aiming for, how important is the  speed? Speed should not be the primary reason why any trader would prefer one  trading venue over another. Low latency can be an advantage for a sell side  customer as it helps to grab quick arbitrage opportunities. However, low  latency can not be a privilege of a few MTFs in the longer term. Due to the improvements  in technology, speed will be available to all players and it will become a  commodity. Speed will boost algorithmic trading which offers enormous value to  the customer. But it can never replace the human brain in assessing the overall  direction of the market and the gut feeling that separates good traders from  the ordinary.</p>
                      <p align="justify" class="Content">All the emerging MTFs offer very similar Clearing capabilities with  Equiduct having the greater flexibility for the customer. The Stock Exchanges  will be able to compete with MTFs on speed and low cost but also have the  important factors of liquidity and better risk management capabilities behind  them and they are not going to rollover and let their business drip away. MTFs  would soon realize that liquidity and risk management capabilities can not be  built overnight and it will take lot of time, hard work and credibility  building performance to achieve that.</p>
                      <p align="justify" class="Content">So, what could be the motive behind sudden emergence of so many MTFs?  They are trying to cash in on speed and cost factor which could give them an  edge over exchanges in the short term. Lower revenues will put pressure on  exchanges who would try to buy these MTFs. It is likely that an MTF expects to  be bought by another bigger MTF or more likely a Stock Exchange before liquidity  and costs come into it. So is it just a game of setting up a business and  system only to sell for a profit as soon as possible? Only time can answer this  question!!</p>

                      <p class="Content">As the sub-prime meltdown completes its first anniversary, the question  that comes to the mind: What should be the strategy for firms for next year?  Where should they invest their efforts and their precious IT resources? To  answer this question, we need to look at the crux of the problem. There are  three key market factors that went wrong which led to the market crisis: a) Due  to the prevail of low interest rates for long term, lenders offered products  which they should not have to people who should not have bought them; b)  competition forced the credit rating agencies issue ratings on complex products  which they didn't fully understand; and c) the poor timing of a global economic  Crisis. </p>
                      <p class="Content">So, what is the right way to handle the situation? First and foremost,  there is no need to panic. While IT budgets will be trimmed, downturns and  dislocations happen; the industry will survive. Governments will still need to  borrow, corporations still need to raise capital, and individuals still need  homes to live. This means that investment banks are still required to lead  manage issue of equity and debt, and fund managers are still required to invest  their funds. Then, how should the 2009 technology budget be allocated? </p>
                      <p class="Content">First, firms must improve their trading and market data  infrastructures, as well as move these facilities to other asset classes and  geographies. Investment in cutting edge trading infrastructure is crucial:  either one invest to stay competitive or risk being forced out of the market  totally. Investment in modern electronic trading is currently in full swing in Europe and Asia in futures, stock options, FX and even in  fixed income securities. </p>
                      <p class="Content">Though firms continue to invest in modern trading infrastructure, such  expenditure accounts only for a small percentage of their total technology  investment. In fact, the bulk of firms' technology investments lie in their  processing capabilities, and investment bank write-offs will transition the  industry from revenue driven strategies to cost driven strategies. </p>
                      <p class="Content">Investment banks usually spend substantial amount in acquiring state of  the art technology but often are poor at re-engineering these platforms into  their infrastructures. While going is good, it is more profitable to invest in  the next billion-dollar business than rebuild platforms. Platform  rationalization needs to occur periodically, and this tends to occur only  during a slump in the markets. Now is the time to examine which platforms are  strategic, which are tactical, which are still useful and which can be done  away with. </p>
                      <p class="Content">To add to the above, firms must attempt at reduction of costs through  further automation. At the moment, the most significant operational challenges  would be in the OTC derivatives business. From front office to middle to back  office, much of the current OTC derivatives processing is complex,  non-standardized and human intensive. Automation and re-engineering of these  processes and technology infrastructure would yield significant profits.  Automation and re-engineering involve not only leveraging newer order execution  venues and central clearing facilities, but also better integrating derivatives  technologies with existing systems. While focusing investments in derivatives  technologies, firms will hike their investment in risk management also as this  will aid firms in better control of their existing positions. </p>
                      <p class="Content">Till  date, as the crisis shows no signs of letting up, we still need to focus on the  larger picture: Financial Markets Industry is instrumental to the financial  health of the planet.&nbsp; Though it may look  like we are sinking into endless depths, fundamentals will help markets find a  bottom and it can only get better from then. So need of the hour is to keep  focus on the basics, rationalize the infrastructure and prepare for a new dawn.</p>
