IBM opening fast bowlers, Girish Velchal  and Sai Krishna, started the bowling spells for IBM and bowled very intelligently. Sai Krishna gave IBM the breakthrough in his very first over. However, UBS team quickly recovered from this early shock and started to score runs briskly and quickly. Momentum was slowly shifting towards UBS as their score stood at 75 runs for 1 wicket from 12 overs. Uday R Pothumanchi deliberated with the team and made some good bowling and fielding changes. Introduced Madhava Vemuri into the bowling attack, which yielded results immediately. Madhava Vemuri got rid of the both the settled UBS batsmen in one over. He also picked up two more crucial wickets in his next overs to ensure that UBS top order batsmen are all back in the pavilion.  Goverdhan and Abdul Mohammed bowled a good spell in the middle of the innings. Sai was brought back into the attack  in the last over and he immediately picked up two quick wickets.</p>
