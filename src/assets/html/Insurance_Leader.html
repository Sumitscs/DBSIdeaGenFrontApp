                    <p class="Content">Near term: Diminished investment  income liquidity expenditure is going to be slow. There is also a predicted  slow down in the Life and Annuities business, while we shall continue to see a  flat to marginally upward trend in the P&amp;C market. <em>(Novarica Oct 2008 report on 2009  IT Budgeting and Planning)</em></p>
                    <p class="Content">While we would likely to be  seeing a dip in the back office support functions, customer facing and web  based support would be a definite area for increased activity.

                    <p class="Content">Long Term: Insurance companies  would continue to invest in IT as it is a Key differentiator in driving the  costs down. IT spending would continue to be as is if not more and there is not  a likelihood of any shrinkage in expenditure. <em>(Gartner Oct 2008 report on IT spending)</em></p>
                    <p class="Content">Future looks to be very exciting with an increased focus  from Insurance Companies towards outsourcing and, to stay in the game, many  institutions would look for Acquisitions and Mergers. We are in the thick of  things and poised to increase our market share with our offerings and  expertise. We have a healthy pipeline, plenty of clients visiting us during the  later part of Q3 and Q4. We are looking forward to closing the year on a high and  pursuing some key deals. </p>
