                <p class="Content">“Thought is the original source of all wealth, all success, all material gain, all great discoveries and inventions and of all achievement.” Claude M Bristol.                </p>
                <p class="Content">Good day ladies and gentlemen, the headlines today:</p>
                <p class="Content">&ldquo;The global financial crisis is going to adversely affect the Indian economy sooner than later especially in sectors such as IT, real estate and export.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="Content">&ldquo;The present crisis in global financial market is likely to worsen the situation further as the substantial demand support to IT majors comes from financial services, this might adversely affect job prospects and salary structure in the IT sector.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="Content">&ldquo;Since over 20 per cent of the country's exports depend on the US market and over 45 per cent of export on developed economies, the export sector is likely to face problems in the coming months in spite of depreciation of rupee.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="Content">In this era of changing climate in the global economic markets  where a storm is sweeping through the financial sector, a cyclone of speculation, and an avalanche of redundancies. I am not going to dwell on these insane observations, but for want of better words I am going to take the help of a short story to point a way of coping with the global mire.</p>
                <p class="Content">A man walking across a dusty pathway found a small baby bird lying on the floor looking for help. He picked it up and took it to his farm and put it along with all his chickens. The hens thought that the bird was one of them and began to take care of the bird, as it was their own child.  It walked around the place pecking the ground and eating the worms and insects. When any predator came near it, it would run away to its alleged mother seeking safety. One day an explorer was passing by the farm and noticed this bird and figured how odd it was among the group. After a close examination of the bird he found it was an eagle. He was really surprised to see it act like a chicken and exhibited no characteristic of an eagle. The explorer told the eagle that your life is not restricted to this farm and you should be flying freely around in the sky and conquer the horizons, but the eagle said that it could not fly and that he is like his brothers and sisters and posseses nothing special. The man took the eagle to the top of a cliff and as he was ascending to the top the eagle was trying to escape, as it was really scared. From the top he just dropped it down and the eagle thought that it would smash itself and die. At that time it suddenly began to flap its wings and as the wind hit against its wings it began to rise up and fly, it flew and never returned back.</p>
                <p class="Content">In our lives as well, we see a lot of people around us. We know their success and failures and we think we are similar and cannot achieve anything better than them. What we really have to do is throw ourselves into the sky and learn to fly.  More often than not, we move on in life without knowing our strengths.</p>
