                  <p align="justify" class="Content">Payment Card, Domain Certification is an Export Blue home grown tool that is aimed to equip the FSS practitioners,working in payment  card industry with functional knowledge beyond the scope of their respective technologies/applications. It provides  a comprehensive  view of the Payment Card industry starting from foundation to higher levels of certification . It will also ensure that  the practitioner  has an in-depth understanding of what is "going on" behind the scene in Payment card industry  and help them to perform task with a greater clarity, thus gaining a competitive edge.
                  </p>
                 
                  <p align="justify" class="Content">Idea for domain certification evolved when Export Blue leadership raised a concern about inconsistent level of business knowledge amongst practitioners and steep learning curve that any resource joining the team had, before he/she could actively participate in any project discussions.The initial scope was to ensure that all Export Blue practitioners are certified in Foundation level course and thus have a consistent basic awareness of Payment card industry.</p>
                  <p align="justify" class="Content">A team of 10-12 dedicated and focussed members were put together with a goal to create a scalable  tool that would house the different levels of courses. Team was divided into courseware and infrastructure/development teams and met twice on a weekly basis to review the current status and discuss and plan for the next steps. Using common quality tools like brainstorming and affinity, the topics for the course was finalized and team  researched and gathered  material for the courseware.</p>
                  <p align="justify" class="Content">Export Blue Account Executive, Sanjay Bhargava and other Sr. memebers pitched in with timely support &amp; encouragement  and helped to mitigate all the issues/concerns related to infrastructure.</p>
                  <p align="justify" class="Content">Foundation level certification course was launched in July 2008 and it was well received by Export Blue practitioners. Work on the next level of payment card certification is in progress and will be rolled out shortly. Future levels of certification courses  would cater to specialization in key  aspects of payment card industry like settlement process, authorization process, card acquisition, card dispute &amp; fraud processes.</p>

                   <p align="justify" class="Content">Here is what Customer had to say how IBM created a difference against the competitors:<br />
                   &quot;Besides creating a competitive proposal, IBM demonstrated a very strong knowledge of underlying systems and technology platforms.&quot;</p>
                   <p align="justify" class="Content">Kameshwar Shukla, Lead Partner, GBS US said - <br />
