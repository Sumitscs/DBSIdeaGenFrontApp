                In Apr 2017, DBS HK successfully migrated its Current Account, Saving Account, and Deposit application module from its Systematics core banking system on mainframe platform to Finacle core banking system on AIX platform.  This was a crucial moment of the journey of Hong Kong Core Banking Project with the joint effort by our strong and dedicated team here in DBS. </p>
                <p class="Content">In this project, HK AMS team worked closely with DBS project team in all project phases (e.g. solutioning consultancy, data migration, system interface enhancements, re-platform of e-Channels & new user functionalities, integrated system testing, integrated UAT, dress rehearsals, pilot runs, and etc) on and all aspects of system touch points (e.g. system & data migration, system integration, batch job enhancements, system decommissioning, etc) of all IBM supported applications on all platforms (e.g. mainframe, open systems, e-channels, branch teller systems, ATM, data warehouse, etc)<br />
                </p>
                <p class="Content">HK AMS SMEs support the respective tracks, providing the professional advice to help DBS teams to define the system features and customization requirements, development, testing and implementation. HK AMS team demonstrated the quick response and flexibility to the changes of requirements, and changes of overall project plan on testing, dressed rehearsal, and implementation from the client.  During the testing and implementation phases, AMS teams maintained a quality work, keeping the number of defects in low level, so the client project team could focus the attention to handle the other important matters in the project delivery. The team also maintained a very stable production environment for all its AMS-supported mainframe applications, before, during and after the cutover.  This enabled both AMS delivery teams and client application teams to free up its resources for the migration project. </p><br><br>
