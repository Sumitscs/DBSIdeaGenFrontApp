                  The publishing of an old article  about a 2002 bankruptcy-court filing by United Airlines (UAL) on Google news on  September 8, 2008 has  highlighted the downside of using automated and algorithmic trading  applications to execute orders.</p>
                  <p class="Content">It still remains unclear how the  six-year old report of UAL's 2002 bankruptcy-court filing appeared on the &lsquo;most  viewed' section of Sun-Sentinel's Web site on Monday. But the item was picked  up by the Google news crawler and appeared on the Google news site as a fresh  report that day.</p>
                  <p class="Content">It is thought that the out-dated  story was then picked up by other news aggregators and was seen by a  Florida-based investment firm which posted a summary on the Bloomberg financial  information service. The posting on Bloomberg prompted automated trading  programs to dump UAL stock and resulted in the UAL share price crashing from  $12 to $3 before Nasdaq halted trading.</p>
                  <p class="Content">The incident has raised new  concerns about the automated systems that are used to both gather news and to  buy and sell stocks based on headlines and earnings data. According to a Wall  Street Journal report this kind of algorithmic trading was responsible for  around a quarter of New York Stock Exchange trades in the last week of August.</p>
                  <p class="Content">But this incident shows clearly  that machines can't always determine if a story is worth acting on and  sometimes human intervention is vital.</p>
                  <p class="Content">Bernie McSherry, a senior vice  president with New York  institutional brokerage Cuttone &amp; Co, told the WSJ that a trader can  &quot;pull back&quot; before proceeding, but some of the less sophisticated  automated trading systems can't do that.</p>

                  BRUSSELS,  Oct 17 - The European Commission said on Friday it intends to make proposals to  control risks in the $60 trillion credit derivatives market, seen as one of the  causes of the worst financial crisis in 80 years.</p>
                  <p class="Content">&quot;Regulators need to have a  much better view of where the real risks in these instruments lie,&quot; EU  Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy said in a statement.</p>
                  <p class="Content">&quot;I would like to have by the  end of this year concrete proposals as to how the risks from credit derivatives  can be mitigated,&quot; McCreevy said.</p>
                  <p class="Content">The contracts are traded  over-the-counter or off an exchange, and are therefore more lightly regulated  with risks less controlled. Contracts could be standardised more, McCreevy  said. &quot;But there is a far more pressing need and that is to have a central  clearing counterparty for these derivatives,&quot; he said.</p>
                  <p class="Content">Standardised derivatives are  already traded and cleared on exchanges such as Eurex, Liffe and the CME. But  the off-exchange market, with its bespoke contracts, is far bigger.</p>
                  <p class="Content">One sector, credit default swaps  (CDS) are &quot;insurance&quot; against a company defaulting and have been  widely traded, with poor records of where these contracts have ended up or  whether the owners have the capital to honour them if needed.</p>
                  <p class="Content">Central clearing for credit  derivatives such as CDS contracts was particularly urgent, McCreevy said.  &quot;No one is able to say how these swaps will unwind. Regulators have little  sight of potential liabilities that could be building up for individual  participants,&quot; he added.</p>
                  <p class="Content">The Commodity and Futures Trading  Commission, which oversees derivatives in the United    States, has said centralised clearing of  contracts is an &quot;immediate&quot; step that could be taken to cut risk.</p>
                  <p class="Content">Liffe said on Thursday it has  struck a deal with Markit Group, a financial information provider, to launch  exchange-traded credit default swaps that are cleared centrally.<br />
                    The European Commission said it  intends to make proposals, including standardization and the need for a central  clearing counterparty, to control risks in the $60 trillion credit derivatives  market, seen as one of the causes of the worst financial crisis in 80 years.</p>

                  The world's leading derivatives  exchange and clearing house Eurex today said, it shares the European  Commissioner McCreevy's call for action to improve market infrastructure in  trading and clearing of OTC derivatives, most importantly credit default swaps  (CDS).</p>

Eurex has an immediately available 'ready-to-use'  solution for trading and clearing of CDS. We are open to create a consortium  with the CDS users to share governance and control of the CDS services.&quot;</p>
                  <p class="Content">Thomas Book, Eurex Executive Board Member, who is  responsible for clearing, added: &quot;A central clearing service will improve  risk management and capital efficiency and at the same time mitigate  counterparty risk.
