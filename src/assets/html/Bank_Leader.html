				I take this opportunity to thank Mohan Peri for his contribution to grow the India team in size and capability span. We are now almost a 500 member team spread across Hyderabad, Gurgaon and Singapore delivering for CST, CBG, IBG groups for DBS in varied technology space including Mainframe, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Javaspring, Tibco, Kony, Teradata, Hadoop, Angular etc.</p>
				
                <p align="justify" class="Content">Taking charge in the last few weeks I had the opportunity to meet and interact with DBS leadership across Hyderabad and Singapore as well as IBM teams and leadership in Singapore, Hyderabad and Gurgaon. I am delighted with the large capability base and knowledge the team has and the confidence DBS is bestowing on us. We have a large untapped collective potential within you that I would like to take leverage for the success and growth of IBM in DBS account.</p>
				</br>
				<p align="justify" class="Content"><strong>Priorities for each one of us </strong></p>
                <p align="justify" class="Content">Be active member in the journey of the DBS transformation in newer technology and banking. Both DBS and IBM leadership is looking forward to each one of you to own your own transformation in line with the DBS and IBM vision - what does that mean to you ? (a) Get trained in newer technology space where DBS is moving to and offer yourself to take up that position. (b) Acquire knowledge and skill on the latest ways of working Agile, Garage methods, Design Thinking and delivery methodologies like Devops and drive for implementation</p>
				
                <p align="justify" class="Content">Drive success for IBM in terms of tangible outcome like profit, revenue and sales as well as intangible outcome of client satisfaction and delight</p>
				
                <p align="justify" class="Content">Become indispensable to your client and replicate yourself by targeting to bring in more positions to IBM
				Bring up ideas at granular level in the area you work and beyond where you think DBS and or IBM will be able to save cost and effort - you have already seen the initiative around Innovation drive. Collaborate across portfolios within DBS and leverage larger IBM team and capabilities
				Enjoy your work in workplace - you will shortly find in different events starting up with celebrations as well as knowledge sharing sessions
				</p>
				
                <p align="justify" class="Content">I am excited to let you know that we are setting up a new ODC in Hyderabad Mindspace 3A, 2nd floor which will be able to accommodate close to 90 new members. This had become very important for us given the ongoing growth in Analytics, Testing and other newer technology space. You will also shortly see we start transforming part of the ODC space to Agile workspace as well. We are aggressively expanding our footprint at DAH2 and are in the final stages of closing the domestic contract in CBG portfolio.
				I am also excited to note that the offshore headcount has grown from around 350 at the start of the year to almost around 500 which is nothing less than extraordinary.</p>
				
				<p align="justify" class="Content">Let us enjoy every moment of our life staying healthy and being part of the client journey of growth and transformation and not be mere order takers....believe me client is looking forward to us to participate. So question everything you are asked to deliver and work out options and present on how it can be done in a more SMARTER way, embrace CHANGE.</p>
